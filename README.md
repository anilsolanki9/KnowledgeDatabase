# KnowledgeDatabase

A centralized, structured repository to store everything I learn about web development and programming.  
This repository acts as a **personal reference manual** — optimized for quick recall, clarity, and long-term reuse.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Capture concepts the moment I learn them
- Maintain clear, minimal documentation for each technology
- Build a reusable knowledge base instead of scattered notes
- Revisit any topic quickly without external searching

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each technology has its own folder.  
Every folder contains **documentation-first content**, not random snippets.

Each `DOCUMENTATION.md`  covers all these areas:

- Concept explanation
- Syntax & rules
- Practical examples
- Edge cases / gotchas
- Real-world usage notes

This keeps learning **structured, searchable, and reusable**.

---

## 🚀 How This Repo Evolves

- New folders added as new technologies are learned
- Existing docs refined as understanding deepens
- Acts as a personal wiki, not a tutorial dump

---

## 🧠 Intended Use

- Personal revision
- Interview preparation
- Concept clarification
- Long-term skill reinforcement

---

## 🛠 Status

Actively growing.  
Updated continuously as learning progresses.

---

## 📌 Note

This repository prioritizes **clarity over completeness**.  
Only concepts that are fully understood are documented.
